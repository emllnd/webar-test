[Prepare image for tracking (NFT)](https://carnaux.github.io/NFT-Marker-Creator/)

This quick WebAR example uses AR.js for tracking images (could also track geolocation anchors) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) as content technology. Other content option to use with AR.js would be THREE.js, but A-Frame is easier for getting started. For instructions and inspiration on what kind of things you can do, have a look here: [A-Frame documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/introduction/).

For example, you could add you own .png image into the application by using the a-image primitive, details here: [a-image](https://aframe.io/docs/1.1.0/primitives/a-image.html). Your own image could be displayed where the tracked image is detected, or any other position.

Recommended hosting environment for testing is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (but other web host can work just as well).
